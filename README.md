# JQuery-Image-Slider

This is a simple JQuery slider. There is no limit to the amount of slides you can use by just adding or removing list items from the unordered list. It uses an oversized div and lines up the items horizontally with the overflow hidden to create the desired slide effect.

The last image is copied to the front of the slide and the first image is copied to the end of the slide for a seemless wrap around effect if sliding past the end of the list or backing up past the beginning of the list.

The small slide indicators and image forward / back buttons are generated by the javascript and are clickable. The slide will pause sliding when the mouse is over any of the objects and will resume after the mouse leaves.

TODO: 
* Clean up the event handlers for the mouse enters.
* Refactor code to a module pattern.
* Refactor into seperate files for css, js and html
